<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

<p>
I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the
<a href="https://www.vu.nl/en" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>
, working in the <a href="http://s2group.cs.vu.nl/" target="_blank">Software and Sustainability group</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in <b>software engineering</b> and <b>software architecture</b> in the domains of
self-adaptive and cyber-physical systems.
My goal is to develop new methods and practical tools for engineering software systems
that are large, distributed, and embedded in the physical world.
</p>

<p>
I particularly like to investigate topics in data-driven software engineering
(using statistical methods), data analytics, architecture-based self-adaptation,
and component-based software development.
